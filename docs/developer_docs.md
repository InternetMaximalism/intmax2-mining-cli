# Guide for Developers

## Build from Source

### For Linux / Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

1. Install required packages and Rust:

```bash
apt update && apt install -y git curl build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

These commands should be run with sudo if necessary, depending on the execution environment.

2. Clone the repository in arbitrary directory and install the CLI:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/internetMaximalism/intmax2-mining-cli.git
cd intmax2-mining-cli
cargo install --path .
```

3. Run the CLI:

```bash
cd intmax2-mining-cli
mining-cli --version
```

### For Mac

1. Install Rust:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

1. Follow steps 2 and 3 from the Linux/WSL instructions.

## Updating the CLI

To update the v1-mining-cli to the latest version:

1. Navigate to the repository directory and pull the latest changes:

```bash
cd path/to/intmax2-mining-cli
git pull origin main
```

2. Rebuild and reinstall the CLI:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

3. Restart the mining-cli if it's currently running.

## Operating Commands

The CLI can be operated interactively or run automatically by setting environment variables. Below is a list of environment variables required by the CLI.
Users utilizing the interactive mode do not need to set these environment variables.
