## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Setting Up Mining CLI

1.  **Lauching the CLI** Double-click on the mining-cli shown in this image to launch.

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/instruction/extract.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

> NOTICE: If you're using a Mac, you may see a message saying "Cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified" as shown in the image. In that case, you need to change your Mac's security settings by referring to this link: https://support.apple.com/en/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac

  <div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/instruction/mac0.png" width="200" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

2. **Select Network**:
   When you double-click the CLI, you'll see a screen like this:

  <div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/p1.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

You can move the cursor with the arrow keys, select `base` and press `Enter`.

### First-Time User Setup

1. **Enter Alchemy API key**: Select `Alchemy` and enter your API key which you obtained from [How to get your Alchemy API key](./alchemy.md) guide. Your API key will not be displayed. Press `Enter` after pasting it.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/k1.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

2. **Configure settings for the mining process**: Set `max gas price`, `mining unit`, and `mining times`. You can use the default values by pressing `Enter` or pressing `y`. We recommend using the default values.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/k3.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Here is the explanation of each setting:

- **Max Gas Price**: The maximum gas price allowed when executing transactions. Setting a higher value will cause undesirable funds loss.
- **Mining Unit**: The amount of ETH to send in one deposit. The default is 0.1 ETH.
- **Mining Times**: Specifies how many times to mine. The default is 10 times for base.

You can also set your own values by pressing `n`, then entering the desired values.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/b14.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Enter your desired gas price. It‚Äôs recommended to keep the maximum gas price at the default value of 10 to avoid unnecessary loss of funds.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/b15.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Select the mining unit per deposit: You can choose either 0.1 ETH or 1 ETH.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/b16.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Choose the number of times to mine: It‚Äôs highly recommended to mine 10 times instead of just once.

**Recommendation**: To maximize your earnings and enhance your privacy:
- Split your funds into smaller deposits.
- Mining in smaller increments (e.g., 10 deposits) can earn up to 300 times the reward of a single large deposit. For example: You can deposit and mine 0.1 ETH or 1 ETH in 10 smaller increments for better rewards and privacy.

3. **Enter Withdrawal Private Key**: Enter the private key of the address you'll use to withdraw ETH and receive ITX tokens. Your withdrawal private key will not be displayed. Press `Enter` after pasting it.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/k4.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

After entering the withdrawal private key, the address will be displayed. Confirm that the address is correct.

_Note: It is recommended to use an empty wallet as your withdrawal address. Make sure not to deposit directly into this address from the deposit address generated for you during mining._

4. **Choose whether to encrypt the private key**: Choose whether to encrypt the private key. Because the withdrawal private key will be stored in local storage, we highly recommend encrypting it. Press `y` or `Enter` to encrypt the private key, or `n` to store it in plain text.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/k5.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

5. **Enter a password for the private key**: If you choose to encrypt the private key, you'll be asked to enter a password. Please enter a password of at least 12 characters.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/k6.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

You would be shown a prompt saying only claiming and withdrawal is allowed for now. Press enter to be taken to the next screen.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/k9.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

### Setup for Returning Users

1. **Continue**:
   After selecting `base`, you'll see a screen like this:

  <div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/p3.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Here is the explanation of each setting:

- **Continue**: Continue mining with the existing settings in the config file
- **Overwrite**: This allows you to clear existing settings and set new ones. It is recommended to create a new config instead until after claiming tokens.
- **Modify**: Modify some of the existing settings and change them, e.g, change withdrawal private key, etc. Note that when using this method, mining times and mining unit cannot be changed.

2. **Enter password for the private key**:
   If you choose to encrypt your password during setup, you'll be prompted to enter it. This step is optional and won't appear if you didn't set a password.

  <div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/p4.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

#### Select Mode

8. **Select Mode**: Choose from the following modes using the arrows key: `Mining`, `Claim`, `Exit`, `Export` or `Check Updates`.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/s7.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Here is the explanation of each mode:

- **Start Mining**: performs mining by repeatedly executing deposits and withdrawals
- **Claim**: claims available ITX tokens
- **Exit**: withdraws all balances in intmax2 and cancels pending deposits
- **Export**: exports the private key of the deposit addresses
- **Check Updates**: check and update the latest CLI version

### How Mining Works

1. **Deposit ETH to your deposit address**:

The mining process will begin.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/m2.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

The CLI will generate a deposit address and display it. In the first time, the deposit account does not have any balance. CLI will display the required amount of ETH to deposit (equals to `(mining unit)*(mining times) + (gas fees for deposits)`). Please send the required amount of ETH to the deposit address.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/m1.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

10. **Mining Process**:

CLI automatically deposits and withdraws ETH.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/m3.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

The mining process will pause if

- the balance of the deposit address is insufficient: please send ETH to the deposit address
- the network's gas price is higher than the max gas price setting: wait until the network's gas price drops or change the `max gas price` value, refer to this [guide](#modify-existing-config-file).
- the number of `mining times` is reached: CLI will generate a new deposit address. Please send ETH to the new deposit address.

11. **After Mining**:

After mining successfully end, you can safely close the CLI window or press `Enter` to go back to the commands page.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/m5.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

You can restart the mining process by selecting `Create New Config` and selecting `Mining` mode when you restart the CLI.

11. **Stop and Resume process**:

There are the wait intervals for depositing and withdrawing during mining process. Minimum interval is 1 hour, and maximum interval is 6 hours. Average interval is 3.5 hours, so it takes 3.5* 2 *10 = 70 hours in average to finish 10 times mining. Note that Interval is chosen randomly each time.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/m4.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

You can safely close the CLI window during the wait interval, when you restart the CLI, you can resume the mining process by selecting `Mining` mode. Mining cli would resume process automatically after the elapses, provided your device is connected to internet connection.
NOTE: If you stop the mining process when there is a balance in the intmax2, you can withdraw the balance by running in `Exit` mode, or you can continue the mining process by running in `Mining` mode.

### Claiming ITX Tokens

The deposits eligible for ITX tokens are confirmed at UTC 0:00 on the Monday two weeks after mining. After that, you claim ITX tokens.

1. **Select Mode**:
To claim ITX token, select `Claim`. You can check whether an deposit address is eligible for rewards in the "Qualified" column after selecting the mode.
  <div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/p6.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

2. **Claim ITX Token To Withdrawal Address**:
   If `Claim` was selected and your address qualifies for ITX tokens, the CLI automatically transfers your available ITX tokens to your withdrawal wallet immediately or when the token availablity time reaches. To see the tokens in your wallet, ensure to add the ITX mainnet token contract address to your wallet using the Network [guide](./holesky.md).

  <div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/migrate/m6.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Check wallet to see tokens.

After claiming process is done, you can proceed to retreiving available ETH in the Intmax2 Network back to your withdrawal address. Proceed by pressing any key as instructed by CLI.

### Withdraw ETH

#### Important: Avoid making direct or indirect transfers between deposit and withdrawal addresses. Depositing in a withdrawal address will disqualify it from receiving rewards during mining. Please refer to the [README document](../README.md) for more information.

1. **Withdraw ETH**:
   Select `Exit` to retrieve assets to withdrawal address.

  <div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/p7.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

2. **Withdraw ETH To Withdrawal Address**:
   Any pending deposit would be cancelled and all ETH balance will be withdrawn to your withdrawal address.

  <div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/migrate/m8.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Note: If there are still ETH in your deposit address after this process, you can manually transfer ETH from deposit wallet to another wallet using the command below. Proceed by pressing any key as instructed by CLI.

### Exporting Deposit Private Keys

1. **Export**:
   Select `Export`

  <div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/p8.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

2. **Export Deposit Private Key**:
   Copy private key and import account into metamask using this [guide](https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-wallet/accounts-and-addresses/how-to-import-an-account/).

  <div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/migrate/m12.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

3. **Transfer in CLI**:
   To transfer ETH balance inside the CLI instead, type yes and select `#0` or your account of choice if you have several deposit accounts.

  <div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/migrate/m13.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

4. **Transfer ETH Balance**:
Paste the address to transfer ETH balance to.
<div align="center">
  <img src="../assets/migrate/m14.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

5. **Transfer in CLI**:
Approve transfer by typing `Yes`.
  <div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/migrate/m15.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Repeat approval until ETH balance is insufficient. To end the process, press `Enter` key.

  <div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/migrate/m15.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

After withdrawal process is done, proceed by pressing any key as instructed by CLI.

### Update CLI Version

1. **Select Mode**:
Select `Check Update` to check if you are using the latest version.
  <div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/p9.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

2. **Confirm CLI Version**:
   Your current version should be same as the latest release to mine. Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/InternetMaximalism/intmax2-mining-cli/releases) page of this repository to see the latest available version.

  <div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/migrate/m24.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

To continue with other modes, press `Enter` key on your keyboard.

### Modify Existing Config File

_**Note**: The modify option will enable you to modify the existing config file settings and change them, e.g, change withdrawal private key. Note that when using this method, mining times and mining unit cannot be changed._

1. **Modify Option**:
   After selecting `base`, you'll see a screen like this:

  <div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/b4.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

2. **Enter password for the private key**:
   If you choose to encrypt your password during setup, you'll be prompted to enter it. This step is optional and won't appear if you didn't set a password.

  <div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/b4.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Here is the explanation of each of the settings you can modify:

- **Alchemy API Key**: This allows you to change Alchemy API key
- **Gas Price**: This allows you to change the maximum gas price amount used in one transaction. The default and recommended gas price is 10.
- **Withdrawal Private Key**: This allows you to change the withdraw address you'll use to withdraw ETH and receive ITX tokens.


3. **Modify Alchemy API Key**: To change Api Key, type `y`. To ignore and move to the next setting option, type `N`.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/b5.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Select `Alchemy` and enter your new API key which you obtained from [How to get your Alchemy API key](./alchemy.md) guide.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/b6.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Note that your API key will not be displayed. Press `Enter` after pasting it.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/b7.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

4. **Modify Gas price**: To modify gas price, type `y`. To ignore and move to the next setting option, type `N`.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/b8.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

It is recommended to leave the maximum gas price at default value which is 10 allowed. Setting a higher value will cause undesirable funds loss.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/b9.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

5. **Modify Withdrawal Private Key**: To change the withdrawal wallet, type `y`. To ignore and move to the next setting option, type `N`.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/b10.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Enter the private key of the new address. Note that your withdrawal private key will not be displayed. Press `Enter` after pasting it.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/b11.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

_Note: It is recommended to use an empty wallet as your withdrawal address. Make sure not to deposit directly into this address from the deposit address generated for you during mining. Also, ensure you use a wallet address that has not been linked to another config file._

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/b12.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

After entering the right withdrawal private key, the address will be displayed.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/b13.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

You can choose whether to encrypt the private key by setting a password. Because the withdrawal private key will be stored in local storage, we highly recommend encrypting it. Press `y` or `Enter` to encrypt the private key, or `n` to store it in plain text.
