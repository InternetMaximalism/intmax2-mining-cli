## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Setting Up Mining CLI

1.  **Launching the CLI** Double-click on the mining-cli shown in this image to launch.

    <div align="center">
      <img src="../assets/instruction/extract.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

> NOTICE: If you're using a Mac, you may see a message saying "Cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified" as shown in the image. In that case, you need to change your Mac's security settings by referring to this link: https://support.apple.com/en/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/instruction/mac0.png" width="200" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

2. **Select Network**:
When you double-click the CLI, you'll see a screen like this:

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/migrate/m1.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

You can move the cursor with the arrow keys and confirm with `Enter`.
For this time, select `base-sepolia (testnet)`.

3. **Select Config File**:
If you're setting up the CLI for the first time, select Create New Config, which will guide you through setting up your mining account. If you've already configured it before, select config of choice. You'll see a screen like this:

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/instruction/m5.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Note: When mining on Base, each config file can only link one deposit address to one withdrawal address. To use multiple deposit addresses, you'll need to create separate config files. If you've already set one up previously, you'll be able to select from existing config files.

### First-Time User Setup

If you choose `Create New Config`, this is the setup process:

1. **Enter Alchemy API key**: Select `Alchemy` and enter your API key which you obtained from [How to get your Alchemy API key](./alchemy.md) guide. Your API key will not be displayed. Press `Enter` after pasting it.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/instruction/m6.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

2. **Configure settings for the mining process**: Set `max gas price`, `mining unit`, and `mining times`. You can use the default values by pressing `Enter` or pressing `y`. You can also set your own values by pressing `n`, then entering the desired values. We recommend using the default values.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/instruction/m7.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Here is the explanation of each setting:

- **Max Gas Price**: The maximum gas price allowed when executing transactions. Setting a higher value will cause undesirable funds loss.
- **Mining Unit**: The amount of ETH to send in one deposit. The default is 0.1 ETH.
- **Mining Times**: Specifies how many times to mine. The default is 10 times (for mainnet), 5 times (for testnet).

3. **Enter Withdrawal Private Key**: Enter the private key of the address you'll use to withdraw ETH and receive ITX tokens. Your withdrawal private key will not be displayed. Press `Enter` after pasting it.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/instruction/m9.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

After entering the withdrawal private key, the address will be displayed. Confirm that the address is correct.

Note: It is recommended to use an empty wallet as your withdrawal address. Make sure not to deposit directly into this address from the deposit address that would be generated for you during mining.

4. **Choose whether to encrypt the private key**: Choose whether to encrypt the private key. Because the withdrawal private key will be stored in local storage, we highly recommend encrypting it. Press `y` or `Enter` to encrypt the private key, or `n` to store it in plain text.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/instruction/m10.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

5. **Enter a password for the private key**: If you choose to encrypt the private key, you'll be asked to enter a password. Please enter a password of at least 12 characters.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/instruction/m11.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

### Setup for Returning Users

1. **Select Config**:
If you've already configured the CLI before, you'll see a screen like this:

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/instruction/m1.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

You can select any of the config files to continue mining with that account.

2. **Config Options**:
After selecting a config file, you'll see a screen like this:

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/instruction/m2.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Here is the explanation of each setting:

- **Continue**: Continue mining with the existing settings in the config file
- **Overwrite**: This allows you to clear existing settings and set new ones.
- **Modify**: Modify some of the existing settings and change them, e.g, change withdrawal private key. Note that when using this method, mining times and mining unit cannot be changed.

3. **Enter password for the private key**:
If you choose to encrypt your password during setup, you'll be prompted to enter it. This step is optional and won't appear if you didn't set a password.

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/instruction/m3.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

### How Mining Works

1. **Select Mode**: Choose from the following modes using the arrows key: `Mining`, `Claim`, `Exit` or `Export`. For this time, select `Mining`.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/instruction/m4.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Here is the explanation of each mode:

- **Start Mining**: performs mining by repeatedly executing deposits and withdrawals
- **Claim**: claims available ITX tokens
- **Exit**: withdraws all balances in intmax2 and cancels pending deposits
- **Export**: exports the private key of the deposit addresses.
- **Check Update**: shows your current version and checks for latest updates of the CLI.

For this time, please select Mining.

2. **Deposit ETH to your deposit address**:

The mining process will begin.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/instruction/m12.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

The CLI will generate a deposit address and display it. In the first time, the deposit account does not have any balance. CLI will display the required amount of ETH to deposit (equals to `(mining unit)*(mining times) + (gas fees for deposits)`). Please send the required amount of ETH to the deposit address.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/instruction/s10.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

3. **Mining Process**:

CLI automatically deposits and withdraws ETH.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/instruction/s12.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

The mining process will pause if

- the balance of the deposit address is insufficient: please send ETH to the deposit address
- the network's gas price is higher than the max gas price setting: wait until the network's gas price drops or change the `max gas price` value.
- the number of `mining times` is reached: CLI will generate a new deposit address. Please send ETH to the new deposit address.

4. **Stop and Resume process**:

You can safely close the CLI window or press `ctrl + c` to stop the mining process. When you restart the CLI, you can resume the mining process by selecting `Mining` mode.

NOTE: After the number of `mining time` is reached, Press any key to go back to the mode options. If you stop the mining process when there is a balance in the intmax2, you can withdraw the balance by running in `Exit` mode, or you can continue the mining process by running in `Mining` mode.

### Claiming ITX Tokens

On testnet, the deposits eligible for ITX tokens are confirmed every day at 3 AM UTC. After that, you claim ITX tokens.

1. **Select Mode**:
To claim ITX token, select `Claim`. You can check whether an deposit address is eligible for rewards in the "Qualified" column after selecting the mode.

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/migrate/m25.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

2. **Claim ITX Token To Withdrawal Address**:
If `Claim` was selected and your address qualifies for ITX tokens, the CLI automatically transfers your available ITX tokens to your withdrawal wallet immediately or when the token availablity time reaches. To see the tokens in your wallet, ensure to add the ITX token contract address to your wallet using the Network [guide](./base.md).

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/instruction/m13.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Check wallet to see tokens.

Follow the CLI instructions and press any key to proceed.

### Withdraw ETH

You can retrieve the available ETH from the intmax2 Network to your withdrawal address.

#### Important: Avoid making direct or indirect transfers between deposit and withdrawal addresses. Depositing in a withdrawal address will disqualify it from receiving rewards during mining. Please refer to the [README document](../README.md) for more information.

1. **Select Mode**:
Select `Exit` to retrieve assets to withdrawal address.

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/migrate/m7.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

2. **Withdraw ETH To Withdrawal Address**:
When selected, any pending deposit would be cancelled and all ETH balance will be withdrawn to your withdrawal address.

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/migrate/m8.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Note: If there are still ETH in your deposit address after this process, you can manually transfer ETH from deposit wallet to another wallet using the `Export` mode below.

### Exporting Deposit Private Keys

You can see the private keys of the deposit addresses. This is useful when you want to retrieve the balance of the deposit addresses.

1. **Select Mode**:
Select `Export` mode.

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/migrate/m11.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

2. **Copy Deposit Private Key**:
Copy private key and import account into metamask using this [guide](https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-wallet/accounts-and-addresses/how-to-import-an-account/).

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/migrate/m12.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

3. **Transfer in CLI**:
To transfer ETH balance inside the CLI instead, type yes and select `#0` or your account of choice if you have several deposit accounts.

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/migrate/m13.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

4. **Transfer ETH Balance**:
   Paste the address to transfer ETH balance to.
   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/migrate/m14.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

5. **Transfer in CLI**:
Approve transfer by typing `Yes`.
   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/migrate/m15.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Repeat approval until ETH balance is insufficient. To end the process, press any key.

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/migrate/m15.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

After withdrawal process is done, proceed by pressing any key as instructed by CLI.
